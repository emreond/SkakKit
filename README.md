# SkakKit

_Skak is danish for chess, so this is a chess logic kit for Swift_

## What is this?

First of all, this a very much work on progress. When that is said, this is a chess-logic-kit to develop applications on. Hopefully when it is done, you will be able to use it as plug-and-play on your own chess-gui.

## Motivation

The state of art local multiplayer chess applications on iOS sucks. So being a developer, i needed to make my own, right? 

## Inspiration

This logic of this kit was first of all inspired by [Sage](https://github.com/nvzqz/Sage/blob/develop/Sources/Bitboard.swift), that inspired me to rewrite all of the logic to using bitboard, that allows a faster calcuations and smaller footprint on memory.

Reading up on bitbards, a lot of informations helped:

* [Bitboards and Connect Four by Dominikus Herzberg](https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md)
* [Bitboard Board-Definition](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboard_Board-Definition)
* [Chess and Bitboards by Peter Keller ](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~psilord/blog/data/chess-pages/)
